# CSS (and SASS)

### Reading list

## Prefer fewer classes

Prefer semantic HTML over numerous CSS classes

Use exceptional state classes only e.g not ‘in-active’ and ‘active'

#### Why?

## Ancestor rules for sandboxing

Consider use of ancestor rules to avoid child components inadvertently inheriting styles from parent

#### Why?


## Class name bindings

Use classNameBindings wherever possible

#### Why?

## Favour modification of component CSS to overriding

Prefer to modify component’s CSS and making it work in all cases over overriding component’s CSS

#### Why?

## Use SASS variables for colours

Always use SASS variables for colours - exceptions can be white or black defined using rgba where alpha is less than 1

#### Why?

## HEX colours

Use hex values over colour names

#### Why?

## Always scope CSS by component

Always scope component SASS file by the component’s name

#### Why?
